## Running Locally üñ•Ô∏è

If you want to run Mini Quest locally, follow these instructions:

### Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, you'll need to start both the Frontend and Backend. Follow these steps:

1. Cloning the Projects
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansoorAZafar/CardClash.git          # Get the frontend
git clone https://github.com/MansoorAZafar/CardClashBackend.git   # Get the backend
```

2. Setup Environment Variables for the backend
  - Create a .env file in the root and assign a DB_STR and SECRET_KEY
    - The DB_STR should be a connection string to a PostGreSQL database
    - The SECRET_KEY should be a encoded string for authentication

3. Run the backend
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Or with docker
dotnet restore
docker build -t cardclashbackend .
docker run -p 8080:80 cardclashbackend
```
Add /swagger to the URL if you want to test it with swagger.

4. Setup Environment Variables for the frontend
  - Create a .env file in the root and assign a DB_URL
      - DB_URL defines the API db URL (aka the backend URL)

5. Run the Frontend

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Or with docker
dotnet restore
docker build -t cardclashbackend .
docker run -p 8080:80 cardclashbackend
